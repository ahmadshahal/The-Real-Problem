# The-Real-Problem

The Real-Problem is a Java project designed to address traffic problems by utilizing intelligent search algorithms. The project focuses on optimizing routes for moving from one point to another with minimal time and energy consumption while minimizing costs.

Features
--------

• Intelligent Search Algorithms: The project incorporates various intelligent search algorithms, such as A* (A-star), Dijkstra's algorithm, to find optimal routes and solutions for traffic problems.
• Time and Energy Optimization: By analyzing traffic patterns, road conditions, the project aims to minimize travel time and energy consumption for efficient transportation.
• Cost Minimization: The system takes into account factors such as fuel consumption, toll charges, and other associated costs to identify routes that minimize overall expenses.
